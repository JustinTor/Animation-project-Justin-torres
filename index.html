        <h1> Stop animation Project </h1>
         <p> In this project we made an stop animation of health and care let me show you what it looks like first
            
        </p>
        <video width="450" controls>
            <source src="P7BLU_001_01.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>

</html>
<p> So thats what are stop animation came too, It wasn't the best or wasn't it finished but I guess it explains what we were trying to explain. 
    So In the first scene of are animation are character was laying down and started feeling a pain in the stomach so he decides to go to the hospital 
    and get a check up. So when are character got to the hospital he was met by the Nurse who asked him "How can I help you today" he responds "im not feeling well" 
    then was brought to the nurse room but before he can get his check up he has to have healthcare for his checkup. <p>
