        <h1> Stop animation Project </h1>
         <p> In this project we made an stop animation of health and care let me show you what it looks like first
            
        </p>
        <video width="450" controls>
            <source src="P7BLU_001_01.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
    </body>
</html>
<p> So thats what are stop animation came too, It wasn't the best or wasn't it finished but I guess it explains what we were trying to explain. 
    So In the first scene of are animation are character was lying down and starting began feeling a pain in the stomach so he decides to go to the hospital 
    and get a check up <p>
